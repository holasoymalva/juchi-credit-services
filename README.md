# üéí Juchi Credit Services 

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Juchi Credit Services, where we specialize in financial fraud detection and credit analysis using Python. Our services are designed to be integrated seamlessly with a Messenger chatbot, enabling real-time interaction and assistance.

## üîÆ Architecture

I create a webhook through the use of node and express, I exposed my local host to the facebook webhook with ngrok, through which I send and receive the requests to messenger, when I receive a specific request For a translation I consume an internal service that I use to call the google translations API, I clean the request and send an input back, some of the requests I send them as json to IA Platform where I use them for self-training and the result I return it as a json to be able to use it in some future. The part of the images I receive the request, if when I receive it I detect it as an image I receive it, I send it to my service and I consume the image processing api to be able to detect the elements of the image.
